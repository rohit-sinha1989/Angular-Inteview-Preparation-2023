### Angular Questions and Answers

# **1. What is SPA? How it is different from server-side rendering and what are the pros and cons of SPA?**
  **SPA** - It means that we don't have anything on the backend but just client JavaScript.This client JavaScript is being loaded       inside the client browser and is executed and then everything is rendered on screen just with the help of JavaScript.
  Single page applications are web based applications that only need to be loaded once, with new functionality consisting of only minor changes to the user interface. It does not load new HTML pages to display the content of the new page, but rather generates it dynamically. This is made feasible by JavaScript's ability to alter DOM components on the current page. A Single Page Application method is speedier, resulting in a more consistent user experience.
